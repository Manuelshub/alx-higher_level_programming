# 0x03-python-data_structures

## Overview

This project contains Python scripts that demonstrate various concepts related to data structures in Python. The scripts cover topics such as lists, tuples, list comprehensions, and other fundamental data structures.

## Contents

The project is organized as follows:

- **0-print_list_integer.py:** A Python script that prints all integers of a list.

- **1-element_at.py:** A Python script that retrieves an element from a list at a specific index.

- **2-replace_in_list.py:** A Python script that replaces an element in a list at a specific position.

- **3-print_reversed_list_integer.py:** A Python script that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.

- **4-new_in_list.py:** A Python script that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list.

- **5-no_c.py:** A Python script that removes all characters 'c' and 'C' from a string.

- **6-print_matrix_integer.py:** A Python script that prints a matrix of integers.

- **7-add_tuple.py:** A Python script that adds two tuples element-wise.

- **8-multiple_returns.py:** A Python script that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.

- **9-max_integer.py:** A Python script that finds the largest integer in a list.

- **10-divisible_by_2.py:** A Python script that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
