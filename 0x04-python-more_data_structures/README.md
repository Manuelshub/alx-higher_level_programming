## Description

This project explores more advanced concepts related to data structures in Python. It includes exercises to practice working with sets, dictionaries, and performing advanced manipulations on lists.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand and use sets in Python.
- Master the usage of dictionaries.
- Perform advanced list manipulations with list comprehensions, lambda functions, and more.
- Solve problems using data structures in Python.

## Project Structure

- `0-square_matrix_simple.py`: Function to compute the square value of all integers in a matrix.
- `1-search_replace.py`: Function to replace all occurrences of an element in a list.
- `2-uniq_add.py`: Function to add all unique integers in a list.
- `3-common_elements.py`: Function to return a set of common elements in two sets.
- `4-only_diff_elements.py`: Function to return a set of all elements present in only one set.
- `5-number_keys.py`: Function to return the number of keys in a dictionary.
- `6-print_sorted_dictionary.py`: Function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
- `7-update_dictionary.py`: Function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
- `8-simple_delete.py`: Function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
- `9-multiply_by_2.py`: Function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2.
- `10-best_score.py`: Function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
- `11-multiply_list_map.py`: Function that returns a list of all the values multiplied by a number without using loops.
- `12-roman_to_int.py`: Function that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
